        <img alt="Acoustic Guitar" src="GuitarNotes Pics/Acoustic Guitar.jpg" height = "250px" width = "500px" class = "revealable.visible"/>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Acoustic Guitar</h3>
        <p>The most popular and foundational instrucment for songwriters and performers. The 
            acoustic guitar offers a warm, resonant, and naturally loud tone, thanks to its large 
            hollow body that amplifies the vibration of the strings. It requires no external amplifier,
            making it the ultimate grab-and-go instrument for campfire singalongs, street performances,
            folk music, and country rhythms. Whether you're a beginner learning your first cords or an 
            experienced musician crafting a new balland, the acoustic is a timeless, essential addition to 
            your collection.
        </p>
            
        <img alt="Electric Guitar" src="GuitarNotes Pics/Electric Guitar.jpg" height = "250px" width = "500px" style = "-ms-flex-item-align: center" class = "revealable.visible"/>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Electric Guitar</h3>
        <p>The instrument that defined modern music and sonic innovation. Unlike its acoustic counterparts, the electirc
            guitar relies on magnetic pickups and an external amplifier to shape its sound. This allows for an unlimited palette
            of tones, from clean and shimmering to heavily distorted and aggressive. It is the core sound of rock, blues, metal, pop,
            and fusion. Choose your model based on the pickups (single-coil for brightness, humbuckers for power) and unlock a world of
            expressive techniques like bending, vibrato, and blazing solos.

        <img alt="Bass Guitar" src="GuitarNotes Pics/Bass guitar.jpg" height = "250px" width = "500px" class = "revealable.visible"/>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Bass Guitar</h3>
        <p>The indispensable heartbeat of any band or ensemble. The bass guitar (typically with four thick 
            strings tuned an octave lower than the lowest four guitar strings) provides the rhythmic and harmonic
            foundation that locks the drums and guitars together. Its deep, powerful, and often mellow tone creates the groove
            and pocket of the music. Whether laying down smooth lines in jazz, driving the tempo in rock, or providing the backbone
            in funk, the bass is the instrument that makes people move.</p>


        <img alt="Classical" src="GuitarNotes Pics/Classical Guitar.jpg" height = "250px" width = "500px" class = "revealable.visible"/>
        <h3 style = "text-align: center">Classical Guitar</h3>
        <p>
            A sophisticated instrument with a legacy rooted in centuries of music. The classical guitar is distinguished by its softer, mellower tone 
            produced by nylon strings and a fan braced body design. It is the perfect choice for fingerstyle playing.
            Spanish flamenco, clasical compositions, and bossa nova. The wider, flat fingerboard makes intricate passages easier, while the nylon strings
            are gentle on the fingertips, offering a warm, intimate, and singing voice unlike any other guitar.
